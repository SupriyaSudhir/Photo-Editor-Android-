# Photo-Editor-Android-
This app is very easy and user friendly to use. It provides variety of filters that can improve the image as per the user’s choice. Since Instagram is becoming very popular these days we have chosen to develop this app that can improve our skills in android and have overall idea about photo editors. Zomato, Andorid Hive. This library offers basic image operations like controlling Brightness, Saturation and Contrast and few image filters. This app improvises the library and hosted it on a public maven repository so that we can integrate in our projects very easily.
This library is very basic and we can achieve great filters like Instagram using this. We have used number of features that currently Instagram doesn’t consists of. So, the motive is the current Instagram can also have such kind of features that will help the users to create different styles of editing pictures.
Most of the people do not use photo editor because they lack in editing their photos. So instead they can directly go on Instagram and choose the filters and features however they want to use. In this way this helps people in saving their memory space on mobile phones rather than installing several editing apps on their phones.
